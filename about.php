          <h3>ClickHudderFax</h3>
          <p>A group of local traders from a suburb of Checkhudderfax has approached us for the proposal to make e-commerce portals for their shop. Moreover, traders want to extend the opening hour without impacting their family life so they can compete with the larger store which is developing soon for 24-hour service.
             From the system, features like search will help customers to search the product efficiently whenever they search the product by name or store. Customers will also benefit from the cart system so they can add the desired product to their cart. Register and login features will help the customers to collect details of users as well as traders. Comment features will help customers give feedback and it also helps traders to improve their products. The secure payment feature will make sure the customerâ€™s privacy and details of payment will be secure. Responsive will help customers for a better experience and flexible way of surfing the app on all devices.
             Overall, traders can provide 24-hour service for their local customers even off hours. Customers will benefit by ordering through their local store where they buy regularly.
